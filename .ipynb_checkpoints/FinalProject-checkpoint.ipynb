    "# Simulating Natural Selection and Evolution in Randomized Organisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The processes of natural selection and evolution are highly effective at optimizing a species' biological fitness and survival rate in a hostile environment. The problem with both natural selection and evolution is that they take a very long time to work, as the genes and traits of a species can only change (naturally) through reproduction. The goal of this project is to simulate the processes of natural selection and evolution for intially randomized species, and optimize its biological fitness for a simulated hostile environment through the use of reinforcement learning, multilayer perceptrons, and genetic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for my project is created implicitly. Organisms percieve their environment through \"Attributes\"; which describe an organism's state (Hunger, thirst, age, etc.), as well as some information about the environment around it (the mean directions of food, water, and possible mates in surrounding tiles). There are a total of 12 Attributes that make up the input layer of the perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning and formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has the massive advantage of me being able to format and normalize the attribute data specifically to be run through my MLP. An example of this is my implementation for calculating the waterDir, foodDir, and mateDir attributes. These directions are calculated by finding the relative directions of the neighboring tiles containing water, food, and potential mates, taking their respective means, normalizing them to a value between -1 and 1, which then the MLP can be trained on to determine the best direction to move in to satisfy the most important of those three needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### MLP Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the MLP is pretty simple, with an input layer (the organism's 12 attribute values), a single hidden layer (18 neurons), and an output layer (mapped to 8 possible actions the organism could take). The weights between the layers \"evolve\" between generations of organisms, using a genetic algorithm to combine the \"genes\" (weights) of 2 parents into a child organism's genetic makeup. There is a simple (and admittedly VERY ineffective) bias system I have implemented to simulate the effect of \"nurturing\", where negative outcomes of an action will make the organism less likely to consider that action again, and the opposite for positive outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last main component of the organisms MLP is the fitness function implemented within the OnTick method. This fitness function rewards organisms for making logical choices (drinking when thirsty, for example), and penalizes illogical choices, such as looking for a mate when the organism is too young to reporoduce. If I had more time to configure this fitness function and fine tune the magnitudes of its rewards and punishments, it would be highly effective for measuring the fitness of an organism. \n",
    "\n",
    "An organism's Fitness score also plays a major role in selecting a mate. When a organism decides to mate, it will prioritize mating with the surrounding organisms with the highest fitness. The probability of an organism successfully courting a mate depends the ratio of fitness scores between the two organisms, where an organism with very low fitness compared to the other organism with very high fitness will have a very low chance of courting them successfully.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "I have recorded a 1 minute demo video showing my simulation in action, here is the link:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are some serious issues with my Fitness Function that essentially cripple the ability of natural selection and evolution to affect the organisms. The organisms are incredibly stupid in the first generation, which makes any sort of meaningful selection almost impossible. This is due to the complexity of the abstractions the MLP must make to understand that \"when I'm thirsty, I should drink water\". Since basically no learning happens until organisms sucessfully reproduce, the organisms rarely sucessfully reproduce before they die of malnutrition or lack of energy. This was why I implemented the bias system, in a attempt to force some variation in behavior that would eventually lead to some reproduction. While this did work to some effect, the mean fitness scores of the population continued to plumit, and rarely show improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What I would do next time, or with more time\n",
    "As you can see, there are some major issues with my fitness function, which is a product of its complexity. I wanted to challenge myself and do something much more complicated than the projects that inspired me to make this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I spent a ton of time on this project, and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't get it to behave as well as I wanted to. If I had more time, I would do more research on how to write a more effective fitness function, and set some solid goals for the simulated organisms to achieve. Despite a working MLP and genetic algorithm enabling reinforcement learning, the complexity and flaws of the fitness function make it nearly impossible to see any actual progress.  \n",
